karnaughgen
===========

Generates LaTeX-code for Karnaugh maps using either a GUI or a CLI.

Requirements
------------

 *  Python 2 or 3
 *  The generated LaTeX-code requires Karnaugh.sty to be compiled to a document.
 *  PySide *(GUI-version only)*

Usage
-----
### GUI-version
```
python karnaughgen-gui.py
```

### CLI-version
```
usage: karnaughgen-cli.py [-h] [-v VALUES] CUBE [CUBE ...]

Generates LaTeX code for Karnaugh maps.

positional arguments:
  CUBE                  A space-separated list of cubes for each implicant
                        that should be included in the output. A cube is a
                        string of 2-4 chars from the set {0, 1, B}. Examples:
                        0B01, BB10, B10, 0B.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v VALUES, --values VALUES
                        The values of the function f. Expected input is a
                        string of length 4, 8, or 16, corresponding to the
                        number of variables (2, 3, or 4). The function values
                        should be in natural order. Defaults to all zero. To
                        pass don't care terms, use the syntax --values=-1-1
                        (note the equal sign (=)) to avoid the parser to
                        interpret it as an option.

examples:
  karnaughgen-cli.py B001
  karnaughgen-cli.py -v=-1-11-1-00000001 0BBB B111
```
